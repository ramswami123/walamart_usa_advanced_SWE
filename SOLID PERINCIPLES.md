The SOLID principles are a set of five key design principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are crucial for object-oriented programming and design. Here's an overview:

### 1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
   - **Purpose**: This principle helps avoid classes becoming too complex and encourages more modular code, which is easier to maintain and extend.
   - **Example**: A class handling user authentication should not also manage logging of user activity.

### 2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
   - **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Purpose**: This allows for new functionality to be added without altering existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into tested code.
   - **Example**: If you want to add a new type of shape in a drawing program, you should be able to add the new shape without modifying the existing shape-drawing code.

### 3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - **Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   - **Purpose**: This ensures that derived classes extend the base class's behavior without changing its expected functionality.
   - **Example**: If you have a class `Bird` and a subclass `Penguin`, substituting a `Penguin` in a place where `Bird` is expected should not break the code. If `Penguin` can't fly, overriding the flying behavior without breaking the interface would follow LSP.

### 4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - **Purpose**: This encourages smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones, improving flexibility and modularity.
   - **Example**: Instead of one large interface `Vehicle`, split it into smaller ones like `LandVehicle`, `WaterVehicle`, so classes can implement only the interfaces relevant to them.

### 5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes), and abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   - **Purpose**: This makes the system more flexible and easier to change by decoupling the components.
   - **Example**: Instead of a `PaymentProcessor` class depending directly on a `CreditCardProcessor`, both should depend on an abstraction like `PaymentMethod`, allowing easy addition of other payment methods.

Applying these principles leads to more robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.
